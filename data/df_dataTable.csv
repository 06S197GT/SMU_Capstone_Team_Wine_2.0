3,France,"A wine that has created its own universe. It has a unique, special softness that allies with the total purity that comes from a small, enclosed single vineyard. The fruit is almost irrelevant here, because it comes as part of a much deeper complexity. This is a great wine, at the summit of Champagne, a sublime, unforgettable experience.",Clos du Mesnil,100,1400.0,Champagne,Champagne,Champagne,Chardonnay,Krug,False,Iconic: Over $50
4,France,"The purest Cabernet Sauvignon fruit, with dark chocolate and intense dark berry flavors. The tannins are so enveloped by the fruit and yet they promise great aging.

7,Austria,"Wet earth, rain-wet stones, damp moss, wild sage and very ripe pear make for a complex opening. Further sniffs reveal more citrus: both juice and zest of lemon. The palate still holds a lot of leesy yeast flavors but its phenolic richness is tempered by total citrus freshness. This is still tightly wound; leave it so it can come into its own. The warming resonance on the palate suggests it has a long future. Drink from 2019.",Ried Loibenberg Smaragd,94,1100.0,Wachau,Wachau,Wachau,Grüner Veltliner,Emmerich Knoll,True,Iconic: Over $50

9,Portugal,"This was a great vintage Port year, and this white Port, which was bottled in 2015, has hints of the firm tannins and structure that marked out the year. It also has preserved an amazing amount of freshness still suggesting orange marmalade flavors. These are backed up by the fine, concentrated old wood tastes.

12,Australia,"This has all the size and weight you've come to expect from Australia's most famous wine. Huge fruit and huge oak combine in a full-bodied, richly textured package that delivers waves of toasted coconut, vanilla and intense dark berries yet remains embryonic more than five years after the harvest. That said, the texture isn't quite as tight or as fine as some other vintages—expect this to be early maturing by Grange standards, and best from 2020–2040.",Grange,98,850.0,South Australia,South Australia,South Australia,Shiraz,Penfolds,True,Iconic: Over $50

13,France,"Full of ripe fruit, opulent and concentrated, this is a fabulous and impressive wine. It has a beautiful line of acidity balanced with ripe fruits.

14,France,"The palate opens slowly, offering an initial citrus character, followed by wood and then, finally, wonderfully rich, but taut fruit. There is still a toast character here, with apricots and pear on top of the citrus, but it is still only just developing.

15,Italy,"Thanks to having some of the highest vineyards in Montalcino, Biondi Santi was able to make a stunning Riserva in the hot and forward 2007 vintage. It opens with aromas of forest floor and dried rose petals. The palate showcases concentrated wild cherry and cinnamon-spice flavors alongside bracing tannins. The wine already boasts impressive depth and structure as well as remarkable freshness for the vintage, but give it time to fully develop.

16,Germany,"Dusty earth and mineral tones lend contrast to sweet, sunny tangerine and caramel in this feather-light TBA. The palate is persistent and pristine, awash in stone fruit flavors that pierce with laser-like brilliance.

18,Spain,"This single-vineyard Carignan is living proof of how impressive the variety can be, especially when hailing from a top year like 2012. Schisty aromas of blackberry, chocolate and mocha are smooth and alluring. This feels focused, pure and juicy, while dense blackberry, mocha and baking spice flavors tail off with exotic notes of Malabar pepper, toast and the finest black coffee.

19,Portugal,"While this wine from a year that was not declared as a vintage, it has sweetness and ripe caramel and toffee character and it does, inevitably, show some age. So the acidity and intense wood flavors are dominant, giving a wine that is dry while still very drinkable. It is a Port that is so concentrated and dense—the distillation of a tawny.

20,Hungary,"Surprisingly subtle, yet maddeningly complex, this is a rare treat to unravel slowly, sip by sip. Sweet and honeyed on the nose with scents of freesia, orange peel and stone fruit, but accented with just a hint of sun-dried hay. The palate is deeply concentrated with undulating waves of honey, beeswax and fruit, but balanced with striking tangerine acidity.

23,France,"With 83% Sémillon in the blend, this wine has weight as well as richness.

24,France,"The wine shows the power typical of a Lafite but within the context of the fruity 2011 vintage. The immensely dense tannic structure gives the wine a solid feel that is lifted by so much ripe black currant and berry fruits. At the back, the wine has a more brooding, dark character that suggests great aging potential.

25,Germany,"Sweet and savory interplay through this exotic TBA, balancing waves of candied orange rind and caramelized sugar with umami-rich notes of sea breeze and dried herb.

26,France,"Big tannins and impressive fruits are the hallmarks of this impressive wine. It is also subtle, not showing all its flavors at once, hiding beneath tannins and structure. For this fruity vintage, it shows a strong sense of direct, solid structure, only allowing the strong black plum and berry flavors to come through slowly. It is for the long haul, so don't drink before 2022, even better later.",*Unknown Wine*,97,660.0,Bordeaux,Pauillac,Pauillac,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Latour,True,Iconic: Over $50
27,France,"From a parcel within the Chevalier-Montrachet vineyard, this is beautifully balanced, but a wine with considerable potential.

29,US,"The former basketball star's initial release immediately establishes itself among the elite Cabernets of Napa Valley. Made from mountain vineyards on Atlas Peak and benches in the Rutherford appellation, it combines intensity with elegance. Bursts with upfront, delicious blackberry, crème de cassis and dark chocolate flavors that are wildly sweet on the midpalate, but then finish thoroughly dry. Structure comes by way of a tangy minerality and finely laced tannins. This is one of those wines that is softly decadent from start to finish, although it's probably not one to hold much beyond six years.",Family Reserve,97,625.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Yao Ming,True,Iconic: Over $50
30,Australia,"This stellar wine takes a little time in the glass to show its true class, but once it's properly aerated, the aromas go from rather vague and lifted to plummy and spice laden. In the mouth, it's rich, creamy-textured and lush, offering the flavors of plum pudding without the excessive weight that the words suggest, plus hints of grilled meat. Again, with airing, it gets even better, piling on more red fruit notes and turning more elegant. A great example of Shiraz, but how many people will be able to justify the $25/ounce expenditure?",Hill of Grace,95,625.0,South Australia,Eden Valley,Eden Valley,Shiraz,Henschke,True,Iconic: Over $50
31,Italy,"A rich, ripe expression of one of Italy's iconic wines, this displays the heat of the 2011 vintage. It opens with aromas of red currants, tobacco, oak and exotic spice while the full-bodied palate delivers dried black cherries, blueberry extract, licorice and black pepper. Densely concentrated and tightly packed with assertive but fine-grained tannins, you'll need to give this time to unwind.

32,Germany,"Hugely sweet yet reasonably balanced given its enormous concentration, this is a tremendous example of the quality heights sweet Riesling can achieve. Golden raisin, dried apricots and candied pineapple all swirl together in a delicious haze of sugar-coma-inducing syrup that nevertheless goes down easily.

36,France,"There is a lightness about this vintage of Mouton Rothschild. It doesn't take away from its quality but does give the wine poise and an attractive lift. The wine is based on solid tannins, then the ripe fruit builds layers of fruitiness and freshness. It is not likely to be one of the longest-aging Moutons, but it will be delicious.

34,Australia,"This is dark and concentrated, as you might expect from Australia's most heralded wine. Oaky scents of maple syrup and vanilla frame hints of mint and superintense dark fruit.

33,France,"This wine is deceptive. At first smell and taste, it doesn't show much—its spice and green-fruit aromas are not at all obvious. It's when you roll it around your mouth, that all the layers of flavor emerge. It is powerful, rounded, but with a fine line of minerality that holds the whole wine on a knife edge. The wood is beautifully judged, the fruit just beginning to develop secondary aromas.
